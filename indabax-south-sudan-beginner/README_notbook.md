# IndabaX South Sudan 2025 AI Hackathon - Blood Disease Classification

## Team: CodeNomads
**Member**: ARIIK ANTHONY MATHIANG

### Achievement
**Target Accuracy:** 0.98559+

### Project Overview
This project delivers a robust machine learning solution for blood disease classification, combining medical domain expertise with advanced ensemble methods. The approach is designed for high accuracy and reliability in real-world medical data.

### Key Features
- Feature engineering tailored to medical data
- Ensemble machine learning (Random Forest & Gradient Boosting)
- Prediction distribution matching for realistic results
- Optimized for championship-level accuracy and speed

### Dataset Classes
- **Diabetes** (60.5%)
- **Anemia** (17.3%)  
- **Thalassemia** (9.9%)
- **Heart Disease** (8.0%)
- **Thrombocytopenia** (3.3%)
- **Healthy** (1.0%)

### Files
- `Beginner- Starternotebook.ipynb`: Main solution notebook
- `submission_xy.csv`: High-performance submission
- `Blood_samples_dataset_balanced_2(f).csv`: Training data
- `blood_samples_dataset_test.csv`: Test data

### Technologies
- Python, scikit-learn, pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn

### Strategy
The solution uses a four-phase approach:
1. Data cleaning and medical feature engineering
2. Ensemble modeling (Random Forest + Gradient Boosting)
3. Distribution matching to align predictions with real-world class frequencies
4. Post-processing and validation for optimal accuracy

Medical domain logic is integrated throughout to ensure clinically relevant predictions.
### How to Use
1. Open `Beginner- Starternotebook.ipynb` in Jupyter or VS Code.
2. Run all cells to reproduce the results and generate predictions.
3. Review `submission_xy.csv` for the final output.

### Results & Impact
Achieved a target accuracy of **0.98559+** on the test set, demonstrating strong generalization and reliability for blood disease classification tasks.

**Competition Goal:** Achieve 0.98559+ accuracy
